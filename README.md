### Reflection

###1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. 
1. The original image is converted to grayscale, which improves contrast and simplifies gradient calculations. 
2.
3.
4.
5.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

![alt text][image_canny]
![alt text][image_roi]
![alt text][image_lanes_full]
![alt text][image_lanes_roi]
![alt text][image_combined]


###2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ...
